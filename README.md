# EC214 - Introduction to Supply Chain Management
_Welcome to my GitHub repository for the supply chain analysis case study, developed for the "Introduction to Supply Chain Management" course at the university. This repository focuses on 2 prominent companies, **Trung Nguyen** (Coffee) and **Zara** (Fashion), providing an in-depth exploration of their supply chain strategies and management practices._

## Objective
The primary objective of these 2 case studies is to analyze the supply chain structures and processes employed by **Trung Nguyen** and **Zara**. By delving into these real-world examples from the coffee and fashion industries, I aim to enhance our understanding of key supply chain management concepts.
